              collect geolocation data that tells us your current location

          <p>Verification process</p>

          <p>
            Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
            determine you are the same person about whom we have the information
            in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to
            provide information so that we can match it with information you
            have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of
            request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so
            that we can match the information you provide with the information
            we already have on file, or we may contact you through a
            communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously
            provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the
            circumstances dictate.
          </p>

          <p>
            We will only use personal information provided in your request to
            verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent
            possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you
            for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your
            identity from the information already maintained by us, we may
            request that you provide additional information for the purposes of
            verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention
            purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as
            soon as we finish verifying you.

              You may request to opt out from future selling or sharing of your

              request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly
              possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the

          <p>Under the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA):</p>

          <p>
            “Consumer” means a natural person who is a resident of the
            Commonwealth acting only in an individual or household context. It
            does not include a natural person acting in a commercial or
            employment context.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Personal data” means any information that is linked or reasonably
            linkable to an identified or identifiable natural person. “Personal
            data” does not include de-identified data or publicly available
            information.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Sale of personal data” means the exchange of personal data for
            monetary consideration.
          </p>

          <p>
            If this definition “consumer” applies to you, we must adhere to
            certain rights and obligations regarding your personal data.
