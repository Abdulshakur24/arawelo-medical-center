# Arawelo Medical Center Website

This project involves the development of a new, more appealing website for the Arawelo Medical Center. The website is built using the Next.js for server-side rendering to improve SEO.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several main sections:

- Home
- Services
  - Pediatrics
  - Dentistry
  - Pharmacy
  - Maternity
- Blog
- About
- Contact
- Privacy Policy

Each section and department has its own dedicated page with relevant information and functionalities.

## Services

The Services section of the website encompasses four key departments at the Arawelo Medical Center:

### Pediatrics

The Pediatrics page provides comprehensive information about the pediatric services offered, including details about the pediatricians, the types of services and treatments available, and how to schedule an appointment.

### Dentistry

The Dentistry page offers a detailed overview of the dental services provided. It includes information about the dentists, the types of dental treatments available, and instructions on how to schedule a dental appointment.

### Pharmacy

The Pharmacy page outlines the pharmacy services available at the center. It provides information about the pharmacists, the types of medications available, and the process for filling a prescription.

### Maternity

The Maternity page is dedicated to the maternity services offered at the center. It includes details about the obstetricians, the types of maternity care and treatments available, and how to schedule a maternity appointment.

## Development Process

The development process was divided into several stages:

1. **Project Planning and Requirement Gathering:** Understanding the needs of the medical center and planning the website structure and functionalities accordingly.

2. **Design:** Creating a visually appealing and user-friendly design for the website.

3. **Development:** Coding the website using the MERN stack and Next.js. Each department page was developed separately.

4. **Testing and Debugging:** Ensuring the website works as expected and fixing any issues.

5. **Deployment:** Deploying the website to a live server.

## Challenges

The main challenges encountered during the project were:

- Ensuring the website is responsive and works well on all devices.
- Implementing server-side rendering with Next.js for improved SEO.

## Learnings

Through this project, I learned a lot about full-stack web development, especially with the MERN stack and Next.js. I also learned about the importance of understanding the client's needs and planning the project accordingly.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements for the project could include adding more interactive elements to the website, implementing a content management system for easier updates, and improving the website's load time.
